# IveBot

The bot that created the iPhone X. It's strictly private. You may run it locally,  but it's not a useful bot to others and tailored for a specific need.

**Requires Node.js 8.5.0 or higher.**

It's planned to have some nifty commands like /assistant which directly communicates with the Google Assistant gRPC API. You heard that, Google Assistant in a Discord bot.

2.0 is built upon Next.js and coming with administrative commands and a web dashboard. 1.0 is still supported and recommended because of its stability.

## Configuration

Set up a MongoDB instance and note its URL. You can set it to store its data in `database` within this folder (you must first make the folder before starting MongoDB)

Make a file named `config.json5` in the top-level directory. It should be something like this:

```json
{
  "token": "<insert token here>",
  "testPilots": ["array of people who can use test pilot commands via user ID"],
  "NASAtoken": "<to enable /astronomy-picture-of-the-day or /apod>",
  "host": "<your user ID to give you certain privileges like /remoteexec>",
  "weatherAPIkey": "<an http://openweathermap.org API key to enable /weather>",
  "mongoURL": "<the link to your MongoDB database instance>"
}
```

You can use comments in JSON5. If you're using a deployment service like Now which supports secrets, then you can secure your token and MongoDB database URL by setting the value of both keys to `dotenv` and then setting the IVEBOT_TOKEN environment variable to your token and the MONGO_URL env variable to the MongoDB instance URL.
